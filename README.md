## 📝 General info
This project is based on a technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. 
The application allows you to create several minutes long sessions with breaks, the user profile contains graphs regarding activity and successes in the application.

## 🍅 Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique helps you resist all of those self-interruptions and re-train your brains to focus. 
Each pomodoro is dedicated to one task and each break is a chance to reset and bring your attention back to what you should be working on.

### Procedure
#### The technique consists of six steps:

#### 1. Decide what task is to be performed.
#### 2. Set the timer for 25/50 minutes (traditional 25 minutes)
#### 3. Work on the task.
#### 4. Finish your work when the clock rings and place the checkmark on a piece of paper.
#### 5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break of 5 minutes and then skip to step 2.
#### 6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break of 30 minutes, reset the number of markers, and then go to step 1.
